# Notes:
#
# - you don't need to put the type prefix (image:, etc) before
#   each source, to make this compatible with older GKrellKams, but
#   it is recommended for readability.
# - make sure to use a single tab character (\t) to indent
#   properties for sources, like tooltip: or seconds:.
# - see gkrellkam-list(5) for more info.
