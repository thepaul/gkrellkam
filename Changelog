-------------------

0.2.2 - Jul 12, 2001
  * Translated krellkam_load into Perl for a little more
    sophistication, and in preparation for more enhancements

0.2.1 - Jul 11, 2001
  * Added option to have each image maintain its aspect ratio
    (Thanks to Benjamin Johnson <benj@visi.com>)
  * Added option to have a border around each image

0.2.0c - Jun 26, 2001
  * Fixed krellkam_load to correctly handle webcam addresses with
    ampersands (&) and weird characters in them

0.2.0b - Jun 23, 2001
  * Fixed panel initialization so that panels match gkrellm theme
    before images are loaded into them (Thanks to Bill Wilson for
    sleuthing out the problem)

0.2.0 - Jun 20, 2001
  * Added capability to display multiple panels, with separate
    configs
  * Made krellkam_load reentrant and a little smarter wrt saving
    local copies of remote images

0.1.1d - Jun 7, 2001
  * Bugfix; GTK methodological error made config tabs mess up on some
    systems
  * Cosmetic internal changes to code

0.1.1c - May 18, 2001
  * Bugfix; error in 0.1.1b prevented compile

0.1.1b - May 18, 2001
  * Consolidated scripts into one more useful script, krellkam_load.
    Can cycle through a list of URLs along with filenames or select
    from the list at random. Changed default script in gkrellkam.c.
  * Expanded tabs in source for readability, remembering that not
    everyone uses 2-character tab stops like me

0.1.1 - May 10, 2001
  * Fixed bug making it impossible to switch image viewer from xv
  * Temporary image filenames returned by scripts should now be able to
    contain spaces
  * Removed debug_print functions, because they were confusing to older
    versions of gcc and weren't needed by the end users

0.1.0 - Apr 19, 2001
  * Released GKrellKam on the unsuspecting world. Well, just the world of
    computer users. Okay, the world of Linux users who run the latest
    version of gkrellm and like adding plugins (there are at least 37 of
    us).
