Planned or considered updates-

- make a source type "listurl" for reading online lists. This will allow
    third parties to assemble lists of images and give out the url to
    their list(s)..

- add shading to image to match a gkrellm or desktop theme. I don't know
    how to do this- I assume I would use the gdk_imlib_set_image_*modifier
    functions, but I don't know how. Does anybody want to contribute a
    patch?

- add internal capabilities of GKrellKam accessible via a special
    command in the list (like a moon clock, earth watch, weather
    graphic, etc)
