Planned updates-

- add shading to image to match a gkrellm or desktop theme
- tooltip info, as optionally supplied by script
- more interesting scripts
- panel config boxes to accept URLs, filenames of lists and pictures
    as well as the scripts now present
- add internal capabilities of GKrellKam accessible via a special
    command from the script (like a moon clock, etc)
