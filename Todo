Planned or considered updates-

- put list management capability into module itself- call wget
  directly, and phase out krellkam_load. This will allow a lot of
  things I can't currently do easily. List files will be able to be
  far more sophisticated and include different settings, etc for each
  panel. Online lists could be used. Tooltip info could be easily
  specified. The data directory containing the downloaded images
  could be controlled, and not cluttered up too much.

- add shading to image to match a gkrellm or desktop theme. I don't know
  how to do this without a *lot* of image processing code. Does anybody
  want to contribute a patch?

- tooltip info, as optionally supplied by script

- panel config boxes to accept URLs, filenames of lists and pictures
    as well as the scripts now present

- add internal capabilities of GKrellKam accessible via a special
    command in the list (like a moon clock, etc)

- add 'browse' button for image source box
