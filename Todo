Planned or considered updates-

- add shading to image to match a gkrellm or desktop theme. I don't know
  how to do this- I assume I would use the gdk_imlib_set_image_*modifier
  functions, but I don't know how. Does anybody want to contribute a patch?

- add internal capabilities of GKrellKam accessible via a special
    command in the list (like a moon clock, earth watch, weather
    graphic, etc)
