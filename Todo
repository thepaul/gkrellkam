Planned or considered updates-

- Mouse scroll to modify number of panels *or* current panel height

- add shading to image to match a gkrellm or desktop theme. I don't know
    how to do this- I assume I would use the gdk_imlib_set_image_*modifier
    functions, but I don't know how. Does anybody want to contribute a
    patch?
