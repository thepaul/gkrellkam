Planned updates-

- add shading to image to match a gkrellm or desktop theme
- tooltip info, as optionally supplied by script
- more interesting scripts
- panel config boxes to accept URLs, filenames of lists and pictures
    as well as the scripts now present
- before an image is loaded, put a theme-compliant background in the
    panel instead of a blank box
