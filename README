I wrote GKrellKam because there's a webcam pointing at the
building where I work, and I thought it would be nice to see what
the weather was like outside without taking up much space on the
desktop. GKrellWeather is great, but this is a little more.. well,
graphic.

The idea is that you can have a periodically updated image of
whatever you want, albeit squeezed into a little gkrellm panel.
A script or program is run by the plugin every N minutes. All it
needs to do is output the name of a file and exit. Once GKrellKam
knows where the file is, it will load it (in any format supported
by imlib) and scale it down to fit in the panel. I have my script
fetch a static webcam image using wget, but you could do
anything. Someone could use it to rotate pictures of people or
things or cartoon characters on her gkrellm. I don't know.

The truth is, I find it a little hard to believe this will be of
any use whatsoever to anyone besides me. If it is, great, and
feel free to email me and tell me what you use it for. Oh, and
bug reports would be helpful. I think this should be pretty bug-
free, but then I haven't tested it under extreme conditions or
on any other platforms.
