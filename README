I wrote GKrellKam because there's a webcam pointing at the building where I
work, and I thought it would be nice to see what the weather was like outside
without taking up much space on the desktop. GKrellWeather is great, but this
is a little more.. well, graphic.

The idea is that you can have a periodically updated image of whatever you
want, albeit squeezed into a little gkrellm panel. A script or program is run
by the plugin every N minutes. All it needs to do is output the name of a
file and exit. Once GKrellKam knows where the file is, it will load it (in
any format supported by imlib) and scale it down to fit in the panel. The
default script, krellkam_load, rotates a list of local images and remote
images, downloading the remote ones into a certain location.. but you could
make scripts to do anything.

The script krellkam_load has been rewritten in Perl for this release. It has
a few new features- you can give it a file on the command line without any
options, and it will determine whether it's a web address, list of pictures,
local image file, or a script, and do the Right Thing with it. This is in
preparation for some changes in future releases.

GKrellKam can do multiple image panels at the same time, with individual
configurations. I thought that would be a nice feature from quite early on,
but it took a lot more rewriting than I thought it would! Regardless, the
capability is now there and hopefully bug-free. Bug reports, if you find
anything wrong, will be quite helpful.

Thanks to Benjamin Johnson (benj@visi.com) for some of the image scaling
code.
