INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

To install, you'll just need to compile the plugin and place it 
(gkrellkam.so) into your gkrellm plugins directory- probably
$HOME/.gkrellm/plugins or the systemwide plugin directory.

Compile using:

$ make

If you want the plugin in your own .gkrellm directory, and it is at
$HOME/.gkrellm/plugins, you can install using

$ make install

INSTALLING THE SCRIPT

GKrellKam needs to call a script to update the panel image. The default
script is krellkam_load, which cycles through a list of URLs or filenames,
and fetches the URLs using wget. To use it, you'll need to put it somewhere
in your path, or give the whole path to the script in the Configuration tab.

If you want to use a different script, obviously, you'll need to put that in
your path or give GKrellKam the full path.

The following instructions should suffice to watch a webcam:

mkdir -p ~/bin
cp krellkam_load ~/bin
chmod 0744 ~/bin/krellkam_load

then make sure $HOME/bin is in your path. In your home directory,
make a file called .krellkam.list that contains a URL or filename
on every line (an example is in krellkam.list.example).
krellkam_load will cycle through these entries. If you want it to
pick one at random each time, change the script field in the
GKrellKam configuration from "krellkam_load" to "krellkam_load -r".
Type "krellkam_load -h" for more usage instructions.
