INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

Compile using:

$ make

If you want the plugin in your own .gkrellm directory, and not in
the systemwide directory, you can install using

$ make userinstall

To install the plugin for everyone on the system, do (as root)

# make install

You need to make sure that GNU wget is somewhere in your path for
GKrellKam to be able to get images from the internet.
