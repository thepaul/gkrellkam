INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

To install, you'll just need to compile the plugin and place
it (gkrellkam.so) into your gkrellm plugins directory- probably
$HOME/.gkrellm/plugins or the systemwide plugin directory.

Compile using:

$ make

If you want the plugin in your own .gkrellm directory, and it
is at $HOME/.gkrellm/plugins, you can install using

$ make install

INSTALLING THE SCRIPT

GKrellKam needs to call a script to update the panel image. You
might want to use my script, krellkam_load, which cycles through
a list of URLs or filenames, and fetches the URLs using wget.
To use it, you'll need to make it executable and either put it
somewhere in your path, or give the whole path to the script in
the Configuration menu.

If you want to use a different script, obviously, you'll need to
put that in your path or give GKrellKam the full path.

The following instructions should suffice to watch a webcam:

mkdir -p ~/bin
cp krellkam_load ~/bin
chmod 0744 ~/bin/krellkam_load

then make sure $HOME/bin is in your path.
