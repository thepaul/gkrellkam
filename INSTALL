INSTALLING THE PLUGIN

To install, you'll just need to compile the plugin and place it 
(gkrellkam.so) into your gkrellm plugins directory- probably
$HOME/.gkrellm/plugins or the systemwide plugin directory.

Compile using:

$ make

If you want the plugin in your own .gkrellm directory, and it is at
$HOME/.gkrellm/plugins, you can install using

$ make install

INSTALLING THE SCRIPT

GKrellKam needs the krellkam_load script, included with this distribution.
Beginning with this release (0.2.2b), krellkam_load MUST be somewhere in
your path, or GKrellKam won't work. GNU wget must also be in your path.
If you are the system administrator, making this plugin available for
everyone, it is suggested you put krellkam_load in /usr/bin. If you are
just installing the plugin for your own use, a good place would be in
your ~/bin directory. If you don't have one, you should make one- it is
a convenient sort of thing to have. Make sure that ~/bin is in your path!

Even if you want to use a different script to update your images, you
still need to put krellkam_load in your path. Your script will be called
by krellkam_load instead of directly by GKrellKam.

If you want to rotate through a list of images, you can create one with
any text editor. Just put one web address or local filename on each
line. (when using local images, be sure to include the full pathname,
beginning with /). Then put the full pathname of that list file in the
Image Source box on the configuration menu. An example is provided in
the file krellkam.list.example.
