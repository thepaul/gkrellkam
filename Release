Notes for GKrellKam version 0.2.2b:

krellkam_load is now required, and called for all image panels. The user
only sets the parameters to krellkam_load. This means that a user can just
enter a web URL or listfile or local picture in the config box and forget
about the script. Another script can still be called- put "-x myscript" in
the config box.

See the Info tab for GKrellKam in the GKrellM configuration window for
help setting up your panels.
