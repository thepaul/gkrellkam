Notes for GKrellKam version 0.3.0:

* Doesn't keep trying repeatedly if a download fails
* Quotes URLs in wget command so that ampersands, etc work
* Manages temporary files sanely
* Includes code for an extremely basic image viewer
* Recognizes the "refresh" tag in lists, to enable cycling
  images more than once without redownloading
* Now lets you give a URL to an online list in the Image
  Source box

(0.3.0b fixes a crash resulting when Select Images at Random
 is turned on for a non-list source)
