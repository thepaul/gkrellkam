Notes for GKrellKam version 0.2.4:

As of 0.2.3, krellkam_load is no longer required. Its functionality is
now built into the GKrellKam plugin. This allows (or will allow) for
more interesting lists of sources for each panel. An included manpage,
gkrellkam-list(5), describes the new list format. The old list format
should still work fine- although GKrellKam will not physically rotate
the list anymore, or even modify the file.

See the Info tab for GKrellKam in the GKrellM configuration window for
help setting up your panels.

As of 0.2.4, the new capabilities of GKrellM 1.2.x can be utilized
(configuration accessible via right-click). The code can still be
compiled fine with GKrellM 1.0.x headers too.

Look for online list capability in the next release.
