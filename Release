Notes for GKrellKam version 0.2.3b:

krellkam_load is no longer required. Its functionality is now built into
the GKrellKam plugin. This allows (or will allow) for more interesting
lists of sources for each panel. An included manpage, gkrellkam-list(5),
describes the new list format. The old list format should still work fine-
although GKrellKam will not physically rotate the list anymore, or even
modify the file.

See the Info tab for GKrellKam in the GKrellM configuration window for
help setting up your panels.

0.2.3b is a bugfix to 0.2.3 to stop deleting local image files.
